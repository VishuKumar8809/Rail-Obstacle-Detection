 Introduction
The Railway Track Obstacle Detection System aims to improve the safety of railway operations by detecting obstacles on tracks in real time. The project utilizes multiple CNN architectures to evaluate model performance, including ResNet, EfficientNetB7, and InceptionV3.

 Features
- Real-time obstacle detection on railway tracks
- Supports multiple CNN architectures: ResNet, EfficientNetB7, and InceptionV3
- Generates alerts for railway operators on detecting track hazards
- Confusion matrix for evaluating model performance

 System Architecture
1. Image Acquisition: Images are captured from cameras mounted on the train.
2. Pre-processing: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to improve model robustness.
3. Model Training: ResNet, EfficientNetB7, and InceptionV3 are used to train the model, enabling comparison between architectures.
4. Detection and Alerts: Once an obstacle is detected, the system generates alerts for operators to take corrective action.

 Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language for the implementation.
- OpenCV: Library for image processing.
- TensorFlow/Keras: Framework for deep learning model development.
- EfficientNetB7, InceptionV3, ResNet: CNN architectures used for obstacle detection.
- Matplotlib, Scikit-learn: Libraries for creating confusion matrices and visualizing results.

 Dataset
The dataset is organized into two main categories:
- Obstacle: Images containing obstacles (e.g., stones, animals, fallen trees).
- No Obstacle: Images with a clear track.

The images are manually labeled and split into training, validation, and test sets.

 Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/railway-track-obstacle-detection.git
   cd railway-track-obstacle-detection
   

2. Install Dependencies:
   Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed, then run:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. Download Pre-trained Models:
   EfficientNetB7, InceptionV3, and ResNet weights will be downloaded automatically via TensorFlow/Keras when specified in the code.

 Usage
1. Prepare the Dataset:
   Organize the dataset as follows:
   
   dataset/
   ├── train/
   │   ├── obstacle/
   │   ├── no_obstacle/
   ├── validation/
   │   ├── obstacle/
   │   ├── no_obstacle/
   

2. Train the Model:
   Train the selected model architecture by running:
   bash
   python train.py --model EfficientNetB7   or InceptionV3, ResNet
   

3. Evaluate the Model:
   Test the model's accuracy and display the confusion matrix using:
   bash
   python evaluate.py --model EfficientNetB7   or InceptionV3, ResNet
   

 Evaluation
The confusion matrix provides insight into model performance by showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

1. Generate Confusion Matrix:
   In evaluate.py, the following code snippet creates and visualizes a confusion matrix:
   python
   from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    Assuming 'y_true' and 'y_pred' are lists of true labels and predicted labels
   cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, labels=[0, 1])   0: No Obstacle, 1: Obstacle
   disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm, display_labels=['No Obstacle', 'Obstacle'])
   disp.plot(cmap=plt.cm.Blues)
   plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
   plt.show()
   

2. Performance Metrics:
   Other evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be computed for a comprehensive assessment:
   python
   from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

   print(classification_report(y_true, y_pred, target_names=['No Obstacle', 'Obstacle']))
   

 Results
The model achieves high accuracy across multiple architectures. Using the confusion matrix, the following example metrics were observed:
- ResNet: 95% accuracy
- EfficientNetB7: 97% accuracy
- InceptionV3: 96% accuracy

 Sample Confusion Matrix (for EfficientNetB7)
|                | Predicted: No Obstacle | Predicted: Obstacle |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Actual: No Obstacle | 470                  | 30                  |
| Actual: Obstacle    | 20                   | 480                 |

 Future Work
- IoT Integration: Implement real-time alert mechanisms with IoT devices.
- Dataset Expansion: Increase the dataset diversity to include various weather and lighting conditions.
- Optimization: Further optimize models for faster inference to improve real-time detection.
